# REU: Adversarial Speech Attacks via Perceptual Modeling
**Project Title:** Perception-Aware Adversarial Attacks on Speech Audio

**Student Name:** Cat Lewin

**Mentor Name:** Dr. Rui Duan

**Problem Statement:** This project develops a perception-aware adversarial attack framework for speech audio that uses AI-driven models of human hearing to create subtle changes—largely unnoticed by listeners—that can evade automated copyright detection systems, with the goal of identifying and studying weaknesses in these systems for research purposes.
