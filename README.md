# REU: Deepfake Robustness via Adversarial Attacks on Watermarked Images
**Project Title:** Speech Copyright Detection and Deepfake Robustness via Adversarial Attacks on Watermarked Images

**Student Name:** Cat Lewin

**Mentor Name:** Dr. Rui Duan

**Problem Statement:** 

**Watermark Robustness in Deepfake Detection**
This project aims to examine the resilience and robustness of invisible image watermarks to adversarial manipulation, and their reliability in support of proactive deepfake detection.

# REU Week 4 ‚Äì Cat Lewin

**Project Summary** Three watermarking approaches were implemented and evaluated:

- DWT-DCT
- DWT-DCT-SVD
- RivaGAN


## Key Contributions

Reproduced baseline (ShieldMnt) neural watermarking model

Implemented classical frequency-based watermarking approaches

Evaluated against JPEG, crop, rotate, noise, and more

## Baseline Reproduction: Invisible Watermark (ShieldMnt)

This project includes a partial reproduction of the Invisible Watermark framework, which provides a CNN-based encoder-decoder architecture for embedding and decoding imperceptible watermarks in images.

[ShieldMnt GitHub repository](https://github.com/ShieldMnt/invisible-watermark)

The reproduction focuses on:

- Running the provided model on a clean test image
- Applying adversarial attacks (e.g., JPEG, resize, crop, noise)
- Measuring bitwise decode accuracy and perceptual similarity

_Note: All code and models for this reproduction were adapted from the original ShieldMnt GitHub repository, accessed in June 2025._

## üîç Project Overview
This repository documents two connected research explorations:
1. **Speech Copyright Detection** using YouTube‚Äôs Content ID system
2. **Adversarial Robustness of Invisible Watermarks** for deepfake detection

## üß™ Experiments
- **Content ID Tests:** 10 audio-only video uploads tested for copyright claims
- **Watermarking:** Preparing to implement the Invisible Watermark framework (Zhang et al., 2019)

## Outputs

This folder contains experimental visuals and screenshots for both phases of the research.

## Speech Copyright Detection
- Screenshots of YouTube‚Äôs Content ID results for MLK and Joker speech tests
- Summary results table of 10 uploaded clips and corresponding claims
- Flowchart diagram of the audio-only testing methodology

## Watermark Robustness
- Visual pipeline for the proposed adversarial attack setup using Invisible Watermark
