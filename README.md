# REU: Adversarial Speech Attacks via Perceptual Modeling
**Project Title:** Adversarial Speech Attacks via Perceptual Modeling

**Student Name:** Cat Lewin

**Mentor Name:** Dr. Rui Duan

**Problem Statement:** This project develops a perception-aware adversarial attack framework for speech audio that uses AI-driven human perceptual modeling to generate minimally perceptible perturbations capable of evading automated copyright detection systems, with the aim of identifying vulnerabilities in such systems for research purposes.
